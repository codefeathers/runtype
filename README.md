# runtype

Runtime type assertions that return.

## Why

`runtype` was created to serve as the runtime type assertion library for [`@codefeathers/poly`](https://npmjs.com/package/@codefeathers/poly). And as such, it makes a best effort to always return boolean, rather than silently pass and loudly throw. Any throwing behaviour definitely qualifies as a bug. Make issues or PRs.
