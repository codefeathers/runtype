# runtype API

`runtype` exports type predicatesâ€”functions that take a value and validate it as a type.

The following list presents the available predicate methods. Note that several type utils are also exposed that might prove useful (like `GuardedType`, to extract the type that a predicate guards) to you. These are not documented below, but can be imported from `@codefeathers/runtype/util`, and have TSDoc accompanying them.

## Always

#### **`T(x)`**:
##### aliases: **`any(x)`**, **`ignore(x)`**
- [asserts] type of `x` is accepted as is

#### **`F(x)`**:
##### aliases: **`fail(x)`**
- [asserts] `x` is never

## Primitives

#### **`nil(x)`**:
- [asserts] `x` is `null` or `undefined`

#### **`null(x)`**:
- [asserts] `x` is `null`

#### **`undefined(x)`**:
- [asserts] `x` is `undefined`

#### **`string(x)`**:
- [asserts] `x` is a string

#### **`number(x)`**:
- [asserts] `x` is a number

#### **`bool(x)`**:
- [asserts] `x` is a bool

#### **`symbol(x)`**:
- [asserts] `x` is a symbol

#### **`object(x)`**:
- [asserts] `x` is a object

## Runtime-related

#### **`literal(<LITERAL>)(x)`**:
##### aliases: **`equals(x)`**
- [where] `<LITERAL>` is a valid string, number, boolean, or object
- [asserts] `x` is equal to `<LITERAL>`

#### **`is(<X>)(x)`**:
- [where] `<X>` is a valid constructor
- [asserts] `x` is an instanceof `X`

#### **`type(<NAME>)(x)`**:
- [where] `<NAME>` is a string equal to one of the possible values of `typeof`, or `"null"`
- [asserts] `typeof x === <NAME>` (or) if `<NAME>` is `"null"`, `x` is `null`

#### **`stringTag(<NAME>)(x)`**:
- [where] `<NAME>` is a string
- [asserts] `x[Symbol.toStringTag]` is equal to `<NAME>`

## Type combiners

#### **`not(<f>)(x)`**:
- [where] `<f>` is a Predicate
- [asserts] `x` does not satisfy predicate `<f>`
- [warning] The type-guard for this method is not accurate. Will always default to `any`. Recommended to use `exclude` if possible

#### **`exclude(<f>, <g>)(x)`**:
- [where] `<f>` and `<g>` are Predicates
- [asserts] `x` is a member of the type represented by `<f>`, but NOT a member of `<g>`

#### **`or(<fs>)(x)`**:
##### aliases: **`sum(<fs>)(x)`**, **`union(<fs>)(x)`**
- [where] `<fs>` is an array of Predicates
- [asserts] `x` is a member of at least one of the Predicates in `<fs>`

#### **`and(<fs>)(x)`**:
- [where] `<fs>` is an array of Predicates
- [asserts] `x` satisfies all of the Predicates in `<fs>`

#### **`product(<fs>)(x)`**:
##### aliases: **`tuple(<fs>)(x)`**
- [where] `<fs>` is a tuple of Predicates
- [asserts] `x` is a tuple whose members are represented by the types in `<fs>` in order

#### **`either(<f>, <g>)(x)`**:
- [where] `<f>` and `<g>` are Predicates
- [asserts] `x` satisfies either of the types represented by `<f>` or `<g>`

#### **`maybe(<f>)(x)`**:
##### aliases: **`optional(<f>)(x)`**
- [where] `<f>` is a Predicate
- [asserts] `x` either satisfies the type represented by `<f>`, or is `undefined | null`

#### **`refinement(<f>, <g>)(x)`**:
- [where] `<f>` and `<g>` are Predicates
- [asserts] `x` satisfies the type represented by `<f>`, and further the type represented by `<g>`. Also: `<f> & <g>`

#### **`Array(<f>)(xs)`**:
- [where] `<f>` is a Predicate
- [asserts] `xs` is an array, where every member satisfies the type represented by `<f>`

#### **`Struct(<struct>)(x)`**:
- [where] `<struct>` is a JavaScript object, whose values are either another struct, or Predicates. `<struct>` may deeply nest as much as required.
- [asserts] `x` is an object whose values satisfy the types provided by `<struct>`'s vaues. `x` must deeply nest in the same way `<struct>` is to pass

## Unsafe

These are escape hatches designed to let you tell `runtype` and subsequently TypeScript to trust you. Make sparing use of these types, and only when necessary. These are hidden under the namespace `unsafe`.

```ts
import { unsafe } from "@codefeathers/runtype";

if (unsafe.own<string>(x)) {
	// x is trusted as string
}
```

This can be useful when you have a complex `or` type, or you have used `not`, where you might lose type information and will have to tell TypeScript what type you know will come out of the assertion.

#### **`own<Type>(x)`**:
##### aliases: **`as<Type>(x)`**
- [where] `<Type>` is a type parameter you must pass
- [asserts] `runtype` ignores everything and asserts that `x` is of type `<Type>`
